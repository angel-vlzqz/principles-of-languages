The set of strings over the alphabet {a, b} with more a's than b's.
aibi | aibi is the string for equal number of a's and b's.
ai | a is the string for more a's than b's.
epsilon = {aibi | aibi | ai | a}

the compliment of the language {an bn | n > 0}
the compliment of L should start with b and end in a, or end with b if it
starts with a
S -> {bA | Aa | aSb}
A -> {aA | bA | epsilon}
