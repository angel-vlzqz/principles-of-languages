Download required libraries by copying the text below into your terminal
```
pip install json
pip install requests
pip install bs4
```
bs4 does all the heavy lifting, it scrapes the web and finds the correct file
from our imports in the java file.

To run the file, press the green triangle on your text editor. If you're a big
boy, run:
```
python3 main.py
```
